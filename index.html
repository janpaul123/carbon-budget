        <p>It's the goal of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">Paris Agreement</a> to limit global warming to <span class="textBudget15">1.5°C</span> above pre-industrial levels. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Report_on_Global_Warming_of_1.5_%C2%B0C">2018 IPCC report</a> says that the world has a budget of about <span class="textBudget15">420 GtCO<sub>2</sub></span>, to have a 66% chance to stay within that 1.5°C. By dragging the knob you can see that if we would cut down right now, we would have to get to zero emissions around <span class="textBudget15">2040</span>. (The IPCC itself uses a 50% chance, which means zero emissions at 2050.)</p>

        <p>That said, <span class="textBudget15">1.5 degree</span> warming is still pretty bad. It's hard to model the exact consequences on us, but we know some things. By the end of the century:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>coral reefs will have declined by 70-90%</li>
          <li>14% of the population will be exposed to severe heat once every 5 years</li>
          <li>average droughts will last 2 months</li>
          <li>271 million people will be exposed to water scarcity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After <span class="textBudget15">1.5°C</span> warming, <span class="textBudget15">2.0°C</span> is the next big threshold. We want to stay well under this per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">Paris Agreement</a>. The budget is about <span class="textBudget20">1170 GtCO<sub>2</sub></span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Report_on_Global_Warming_of_1.5_%C2%B0C">since 2018</a> (which includes the <span class="textBudget15">1.5°C</span> budget).

        <p>It is harder to predict what would happen in this case, since it's further out, but to give you an idea, by the end of the century:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>coral reefs will have declined by <span class="textBudget20">99%</span> (vs <span class="textBudget15">70-90%</span>)</li>
          <li><span class="textBudget20">37%</span> of the population will be exposed to severe heat once every 5 years (vs <span class="textBudget15">14%</span>)</li>
          <li>average droughts will last <span class="textBudget20">4 months</span> (vs <span class="textBudget15">2 months</span>)</li>
          <li><span class="textBudget20">388 million</span> people will be exposed to water scarcity  (vs <span class="textBudget15">271 million</span>).</li>

        <p>When we get past <span class="textBudget15">2.0°C</span>, things get tricky. Self-reinforcing natural feedback loops get activated, which can accelerate warming automatically, to potentially above <span class="textBudgetDead">10.0°C</span>. This would cause mass extinction of species, and make much of the planet uninhabitable.

      The <span class="textBudget15">green</span> and <span class="textBudget20">orange</span> areas are the "carbon budgets" for <span class="textBudget15">1.5</span> and <span class="textBudget20">2</span> degrees warming. If we don't do something, we'd blow through them in a few years. Drag the knob to see how we can stay within these budgets.
